What you've learned
In this section, you learned quite a bit. Here are the highlights of the learning.
• The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
• Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories.
• Directories can also store other directories, which forms a "directory tree".
• cd path changes the present working directory to the indicated path.
• ls path prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the contents of the present working directory.
• pwd prints the user’s present working directory.
• / on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
• A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
• An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
• Directory names in a path are separated with / on Unix-like systems.
• ".." means ‘the directory above the current one’.
